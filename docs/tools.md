## Task 3:  Asking the right questions 
### Background 
Learning how to ask interesting questions takes time.  As data scientists we need to learn how to ask questions that data can answer.  [This task supports your semester project](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/project.html). **Note that the reading on data transformation below is necessary for the case study for this week and may be the most important reading of the semester to fully understand**
