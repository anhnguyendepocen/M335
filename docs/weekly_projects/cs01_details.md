## Case Study 1: Critiquing Visualizations and Slack Setup 
### Background 
Your first weekly project requires you to **submit** a review of 4-5 different data visualizations used to answer specific questions.  Some fun websites are [wonkblog](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/?utm_term=.c10a343a7262){target="blank"}, [fivethiryeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/){target="blank"}, and [priceonomics](https://priceonomics.com/){target="blank"} (but you can use any website, blog, or article with a good visualization).

The **submit** word above will require you to create an account on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/byuidwv/signup?x=x-339637048932-339197858336){target="blank"}.  Our slack channel is byuidwv.slack.com.  You must use your `@byui.edu` email to create an account.
