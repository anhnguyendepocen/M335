I made up databending.  It does not mean that we make up data or that we alter it.  Like [airbenders](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Airbending){target="blank"} we control our data to answer the questions we need answered.  The key to databending is flexibility and finding and following the path of least resistence.
