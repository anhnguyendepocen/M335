## Case Study 7: Counting names in scripture 
### Background 

In 1978 Susan Easton Black [penned an article](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/07/discovery?lang=eng){target="blank"} in the Ensign title *Even statistically, he is the dominant figure of the Book of Mormon.* which makes some statistical claims about the Book of Mormon.  With our "string" skills we are going to check her result and build an improved statistic using using number of words between references.
