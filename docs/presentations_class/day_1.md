# What is a data scientist?

## A blend of programmer, statistician, and communicator that burns with curiosity.

- [Medium.com on data science](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/what-makes-a-good-data-scientist-engineer-a8b4d7948a86){target="blank"}
    - **Read through the bulleted items and rank the bolded phrases in order of importance.**
- **The truth:**  The definition is settling, but the professional title of data science still covers a broad set of people and skills.

## When we say "blend" we can just as easily be saying the following.

<span style="font-size:75px"><span style="color:gold">
An almost scientist that can't quite program, often isn't the best statistician in the room and asks too many questions

## Syllabus

### [MATH/CS 335 Syllabus](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/syllabus.html){target="blank"}


> * Preparation: **What are the class expectations on preparation?**
> * Performance: **How will assignments be "graded"?**
> * Semester Grade:  **How will you know what grade you earn?**



## MATH/CS 335 Philosophy

> - In a specifications-grading system all tasks are evaluated on a high-standards pass/fail basis using detailed checklists of task requirements and expectations. 
> - Letter grades are earned by passing marks on a set of tasks. 
> - This system provides for a variety of choice and is closer to how learning, and work, is done in the real world.
> - It will be easy for us to tell if work is complete, done in good faith, and consistent with the requirements.

# Weekly Case Study 

## Case Study Format

- [Week 1](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/weekly_projects/cs01_details.html){target="blank"} and [Week 2](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/weekly_projects/cs02_details.html){target="blank"} are slightly different.
- [Week 3](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/weekly_projects/cs03_details.html){target="blank"} begins the standard case study format.
    1. Open ended question to answer with data provided    
    ...   
    2. Compile your `.md` and `.html` file into your git repository
    3. Find two other student's compiled files in their repository and provide feedback using the issues feature in GitHub (If they already have three issues find a different student to critique)
    4. Address 1-2 of the issues posted on your project and push the updates to GitHub
