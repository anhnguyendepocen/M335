## Rauser on Cholera

[Remembering the question: A cholera example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3dw09N5_Aw)

  - 3:00 What are the good methods he uses to provide background on the domain science?
  - 3:37 If we had to prove that cholera wasn't passed by the air what type of data would we need?
  - 4:52 Do you think this is compelling? 
  - 5:33 Can we do this experiment?
  - 7:22 The data scientist has to find the data.
  - 9:31 The data scientist has to give the data purpose.
  - 11:00 Finding the unique features provide the experimentation value. 

## Great Quotes

- Correlation does not imply causation... The most popular defense of tiny minds in the face of uncomfortable evidence.
- You are rewarded for finding answers to the "that's funny" statements.

## Why is this a poor example of non-aligned scales?

# Remember and DataTables

## Remember the Goal

"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'" -Isaac Asimov

## library(DT) - DataTables

Look at the [DT: An R interface to the DataTables library](http://rstudio.github.io/DT/) website and find one or two modifications that you could make to your table output to move beyond the default.

> * Work as a table and push one file to R-Studio connect.
> * Make sure everyone at the table has the code saved on their computers.




```r
library(DT)
datatable(iris)
```
