## Posting Comments on Class Case Studies

Why are we making comments on other's work?

[My example](https://github.com/BYUI335/Pyeatt_A/issues/7) for discussion.

## Semester Project Discussion

Please make your own issue right now.

> - Use my issue as a starting point - <https://github.com/BYUI335/hathaway/issues/16>.
> - Create a new folder in your repository that is called `semester_project`.
> - If you would like to alter the project, then post a comment to the semester project issue with your update.
> - Call me out and ask me to review and approve changes.

## Tracking Progress

> - Don't forget to keep track of your tasks.
> - Semester project should be moving along.
> - Check out week 13 work and make sure you are working on this.

# Geospatial Data


## What is GDAL?

The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) is a C/C++ geospatial data format translation programming library and associated set of utility programs built using the library. GDAL is one of the jewels of the open source community, and I want to help you understand how to leverage its power to process spatial data.

## Is the earth flat?

## Which area is larger - The continental 48 states or the country of Brazil?

- While a few basketbal players may think the earth is flat, is education feeding us stuff that isn't true?

## What are projections?

* **Which map is correct?**
* **Which map shows area correctly?**

![](..\images\mercator.jpg){ width=40% } ![](..\images\gall-peters.png){ width=45% } 

## When we make a map, what is our goal?

* ![](..\images\cahill-keyes.jpg){ width=90% }
* The [cahill-keyes projection looks pretty good](https://xkcd.com/977/).

## Convert to another projection

> * Take a minute and look up projections that you like and get your Task 19 graphic into that projection - http://proj4.org/projections/index.html
> * http://proj4.org/parameters.html
>     * +lon_0     Central meridian
>     * +lat_0     Latitude of origin
