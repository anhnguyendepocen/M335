#  Surveys, Slack, and Learning

## Our survey

Could we take a minute and fill out some surveys about the class.  I would like you guys to do this after you have completed each task (2 during the week and the Saturday case study).

## Seriously!
### How do you get people to percieve you are smart?

## Slack and Learning

This space is for us to build a team.  This is where we learn to ask questions correctly and learn to answer them correctly.

# GitHub and Git

## Really do I have to learn Git and GitHub

[2015 Wired Magazine Article](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/github-conquered-google-microsoft-everyone-else/)

- GitHub now boasts almost 9 million registered users. Each month, about 20 million others visit without registering. ... GitHub is now among the **top 100 most popular sites on earth**.
- Now, pretty much everyone hosts their open source projects on GitHub, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and even Microsoft. 
- the site as a kind of bazaar that offers just about any piece of code you might want-and so much of it free. "If you need something, you just go to GitHub," he says. "You will find it there."

##  Making sure we are all on the same page

Let's take a few minutes to make sure everyone is up to date with the following tasks.
