<h2>Task 9: Same Data Different Format</h2>
<p>Data formats are varied and differ by domains and software. We could spend weeks on the different formats and file types that companies and governments use to store their data. We will practice with a few standard formats that are often used for storing data. In the future, you will most likely have to do some research to figure out other formats (but you can do it with R or Python). We have a challenge to read in the five formats of the <a href="https://github.com/byuistats/data/tree/master/Dart_Expert_Dow_6month_anova" target="blank">DOW data</a> and checking that they are all identical using <code>all.equal()</code>. One final note, your R script should do all the work. That is your script should download the files and/or read directly from the web location of the file.</p>

<h2>Task 10: Clean and Reformat (aka tidy)</h2>
<p>With stock return data from the previous task, we need to tidy this data for the creation of a time series plot. We want to look at the returns for each six-month period of the year in which the returns were reported. Your plot should highlight the tighter spread of the DJIA as compared to the other two selection methods (DARTS and PROS). We need to display a table of the DJIA returns with months on the rows and years in the columns (i.e. “spread” the data).</p>

<h2>Task 11: Take me out to the ball game</h2>
<p>Over the campfire, you and a friend get into a debate about which college in Utah has had the best MLB success. As an avid BYU fan, you want to prove your point, and you go to data to settle the debate. You need a clear visualization that depicts the performance of BYU players compared to other Utah college players that have played in the major leagues. The <code>library(Lahman)</code> package has a comprehensive set of baseball data. It is great for testing out our relational data skills. We will also need a function to inflation adjust the player salaries - <code>library(blscrapeR)</code>. See <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blscrapeR/vignettes/Inflation_and_Prices.html" target="blank">this guide for an example</a>.</p>

<h2>Task 12: Strings and grep</h2>
<p>Using global regular expression print (grep) and regular expressions (regex) to find character string patterns is a valuable tool in data analysis and is available with all operating systems and many different programming languages. It is a powerful tool once it is understood. The recently developed <code>library(stringr)</code> package makes these tools much easier to use. The three tasks below can be completed in many different ways. As a challenge, my code to complete this entire task less than 10 lines.</p>

<h2>Task 13: Controlling categorical variables (factors)</h2>
<p>When we are visualizing data with categorical variables, we have to deal with character strings as groupings. The problem with summarizing categorical data in a table or a plot is how to order the groups. Using the concept of Factors allows us to dictate the order of these groupings for presentation. We will revisit the <a href="https://github.com/byuistats/data/tree/master/Dart_Expert_Dow_6month_anova" target="blank">stock data</a> from a previous task to create a table and a plot that has the months correctly labeled and ordered.</p>

We are going to use some of our “string” skills to count words and occurrences in the New Testament and in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the average verse length (number of words) in the New Testament compared to the Book of Mormon?</li>

<h2>Task 15: How is the weather?</h2>
<p>Use the <code>library(riem)</code> package that is described <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/riem" target="blank">here</a> and get the month of June for 2015, 2016, and 2017. You would use <code>riem_measures(station = &quot;RXE&quot;, date_start = &quot;2015-06-01&quot;, date_end = &quot;2017-07-01&quot;)</code> for station <code>RXE</code>. Once you have downloaded and formated the data, make sure to save it to your analysis folder as it will take a minute or two to download each time. We have a few coding tasks to help us get used to using dates. Create a visualization for each question.</p>

<h2>Task 17: My investment is better than yours</h2>
<p>The stock market is overflowing with data. There are many packages in R that allow us to get quick access to information on publicly traded companies. Imagine that you and a friend each purchased about $1,000 of stock in three different stocks at the start of October last year, and you want to compare your performance up to this week. Use the stock shares purchased and share prices to demonstrate how each of you fared over the period you were competing (assuming that you did not change your allocations).</p>

<p>Up to this point, we have dealt with data that fits into the tidy format without much effort. Spatial data has many complicating factors that have made handling spatial data in R complicated. Big strides are being made to make spatial data tidy in R. However; we are in the middle of the transition.</p>
<p>We will use <code>library(USAboundaries)</code>, <code>library(ggrepel)</code>, and <code>library(sf)</code> to make a map of the US and show the top 3 largest cities in each state. Specifically, you will use <code>library(ggplot2)</code> and the function <code>geom_sf()</code> to recreate the provided image.</p>

<p>We have been asked by the state of Idaho to visualize permitted well locations with a production of more than 5000 gallons and the spatial relationship of the large wells to the locations of large dams (surface area larger than 50 acres). They have provided a a <a href="https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/shp.zip">shp file</a> for us and given us a web address for the <a href="https://research.idwr.idaho.gov/gis/Spatial/Wells/WellConstruction/wells.zip">well</a>, <a href="https://research.idwr.idaho.gov/gis/Spatial/DamSafety/dam.zip">dam</a>, and <a href="https://research.idwr.idaho.gov/gis/Spatial/Hydrography/streams_lakes/c_250k/hyd250.zip">water</a> locations. They would like to have the <code>Snake River</code> and <code>Henrys Fork</code> rivers plotted.</p>
<p>Their US map is projected to show the entire US. You will need to subset the data to Idaho and then reproject the map, so Idaho is not tilted.</p>

<h2>Case Study 4: Reducing Gun Deaths (FiveThirtyEight)</h2>

As leaders in data journalism, they have posted a clean version of this data in their GitHub repo called <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data" target="blank">full_data.csv</a> for us to use.</p>
<p>While their visualizations focused on yearly averages, our client wants to create commercials that help reduce the gun deaths in the US. They would like to target the commercials in different seasons of the year (think month variable) to audiences that could have the most impact in reducing gun deaths. Our challenge is to summarize and visualize seasonal trends accros the other variables in these data.</p>

They <a href="https://github.com/hathawayj/buildings" target="blank">provided you a dataset</a> of all commercial construction in Idaho for those two years. The data has a variable <code>Type</code> with a general category called <code>Food_Beverage_Service</code> that has other buildings besides restaurants in the category. You will need to use the restaurant names (see <code>restaurants</code> data object) and some additional key words to create the correct subgroupings. Your client expects to provide new data for 2010 and 2011 so your script needs to do the work. Make sure you do not use Excel to manipulate anything.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

Your boss has asked you to go through the transactions for each business and provide daily, weekly, and monthly gross revenue summaries and comparisons. Your boss would like a short write up with tables and visualizations that help with the decision of which company did the best over the three month period. You will also need to provide a short paragraph with your recommendation after building your analysis.</p>

<p>Your data science income has ballooned, and you need to find somewhere to invest $25,000 that you have saved over the last year. You have a savvy investment friend that is kind enough to tell you ten stocks he has been watching during the last year. You will need to visualize the last five years performance to help in the in the conversation with your friend.</p>
<p>Your friend is going to give you his tickers at the beginning of your half-hour meeting with him (he is a busy friend). You will need to build an <code>.Rmd</code> file that will build a suite of visualizations rapidly for your conversation. You will need a series of stock performance graphics using <code>library(dygraphs)</code> and <code>library(ggplot2)</code>. In real life, you might use one or the other, but this task is built to help you move from <code>ts</code> and <code>xts</code> to <code>tidy</code> objects for visualization.</p>
<p>Specifically, in class the Tuesday following this case study you will get 5 - 10 ticker symbols and will need to build visualizations quickly that allows you to answer questions about the stocks in a few seconds.</p>
