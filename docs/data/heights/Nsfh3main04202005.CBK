How did it happen that (he/she/they) started living with your brother
or sister?  If it happened more than once, tell me about the
most recent time.  Was it because your parent was ill or disabled,
your sibling was ill or disabled, your parent had financial problems,
or your parent was providing other assistance to your sibling?

We understand your concern, but would appreciate your giving us
[fill SFN]'s  [fill PFN]'s  name and number so
that our sample will better represent family life throughout the United

As always the responses are completely confidential and not connected
in any way with your name or your spouse's partner's name.

(IF RESPONDENT ASKS: THIS INTERVIEW WILL TAKE ABOUT 75 MINUTES.)
