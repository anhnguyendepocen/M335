Some fun websites are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/?utm_term=.c10a343a7262" target="blank">wonkblog</a>, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="blank">fivethiryeight</a>, and <a href="https://priceonomics.com/" target="blank">priceonomics</a> (but you can use any website, blog, or article with a good visualization).</p>
<p>The <strong>submit</strong> word above will require you to create an account on <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/byuidwv/signup?x=x-339637048932-339197858336" target="blank">slack</a>.

You can find the code for the majority of his graphics <a href="https://github.com/jrauser/writing/blob/master/how_humans_see_data/hhsd_notes.Rmd" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>This task is intended to get all of us on the same page in R. You will use the <code>library(swirl)</code> package to learn how to use R. We will be covering Lessons 1-7. Even if you have used R before, this will be an excellent refresher. If the sending of an email in the swirl practice does not work do not worry about it. If you do not get the title of this task, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMCsXl9SGgY">this</a>.</p>

<p>You just started your internship at a big firm in New York, and your manager gave you an extensive file of flights that departed JFK, LGA, or EWR in 2013. From this data (<code>nycflights13::flights</code>), which you can obtain in R (<code>install.packages(&quot;nycflights13&quot;); library(nycflights13)</code>), your manager wants you to answer the following questions;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If I am leaving before noon, which two airlines do you recommend at each airport (JFK, LGA, EWR) that will have the lowest delay time at the 75th percentile?</li>
<li>Which origin airport is best to minimize my chances of a late arrival when I am using Delta Airlines?</li>
<li>Which destination airport is the worst (you decide on the metric for worst) airport for arrival time?</li>

<p>Before we can start to answer business questions we need to become familiar with our data. Often, you will want to start with the <a href="https://www.bridging-the-gap.com/data-dictionary/">data dictionary</a>. However, you can also just dive into the data and gain understanding based on the variable names and types.</p>
<p>Beyond the variable descriptions is how the variables relate to each other. We can create tables or visualizations that summarize how different variables relate to each other. At this point we are deepeing our understanding as well as beginning our analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Remember: Your job is to become the data expert not the domain expert.</strong> You will build domain skills but you are not going to replace domain experts. People will depend on you to have a firm understanding of what data your company has available to answer domain specific questions.</p>

As leaders in data journalism, they have posted a clean version of this data in their GitHub repo called <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data" target="blank">full_data.csv</a> for us to use.</p>
<p>While their visualizations focused on yearly averages, our client wants to create commercials that help reduce the gun deaths in the US. They would like to target the commercials in different seasons of the year (think month variable) to audiences that could have the most impact in reducing gun deaths. Our challenge is to summarize and visualize seasonal trends accros the other variables in these data.</p>

<p>Data formats are varied and differ by domains and software. We could spend weeks on the different formats and file types that companies and governments use to store their data. We will practice with a few standard formats that are often used for storing data. In the future, you will most likely have to do some research to figure out other formats (but you can do it with R or Python). We have a challenge to read in the five formats of the <a href="https://github.com/byuistats/data/tree/master/Dart_Expert_Dow_6month_anova" target="blank">DOW data</a> and checking that they are all identical using <code>all.equal()</code>.

You have a savvy investment friend that is kind enough to tell you ten stocks he has been watching during the last year. You will need to visualize the last five years performance to help in the in the conversation with your friend.</p>
<p>Your friend is going to give you his tickers at the beginning of your half-hour meeting with him (he is a busy friend). You will need to build an <code>.Rmd</code> file that will build a suite of visualizations rapidly for your conversation. You will need a series of stock performance graphics using <code>library(dygraphs)</code> and <code>library(ggplot2)</code>. In real life, you might use one or the other, but this task is built to help you move from <code>ts</code> and <code>xts</code> to <code>tidy</code> objects for visualization.</p>

<p>The stock market is overflowing with data. There are many packages in R that allow us to get quick access to information on publicly traded companies. Imagine that you and a friend each purchased about $1,000 of stock in three different stocks at the start of October last year, and you want to compare your performance up to this week. Use the stock shares purchased and share prices to demonstrate how each of you fared over the period you were competing (assuming that you did not change your allocations).</p>

<h3>3/7 (9.18)</h3>
<p>Interactive visualizations can often be powerful for data investigations. They let your team get at questions in real time. Use the Kroger (KR) stock price to build an interactive visualization of their performance over the last five years. Take some time to build a couple of different visualizations that show Krogers performance. See the task items below for a description.</p>

<h3>11/15 (9.18)</h3>
<p>Interactive visualizations can often be powerful for data investigations. They let your team get at questions in real time. Use the Kroger (KR) stock price to build an interactive visualization of their performance over the last five years. Annotate the graphic with a note of the reason at two or more time points, or intervals, where the price had significant shifts.</p>

<p>You have been asked to support a story for the local paper (that has a web presence) that looks back on the housing collapse and the early effects of residential construction. You have data on residential building permits from 1980 through 2010 for each county in the United States. Your colleague that is writing the article would like a few maps and graphics that highlight the single family building permit patterns across your state as well as the patterns in the US.</p>
<p>Remember the big story is the collapse of new building permits at the initial stages of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis" target="blank">mortgage crisis</a>. Make sure your graphics highlight the collapse in a clear and honest manner.</p>

<p>Up to this point, we have dealt with data that fits into the tidy format without much effort. Spatial data has many complicating factors that have made handling spatial data in R complicated. Big strides are being made to make spatial data tidy in R. However; we are in the middle of the transition.</p>
<p>We will use <code>library(USAboundaries)</code>, <code>library(ggrepel)</code>, and <code>library(sf)</code> to make a map of the US and show the top 3 largest cities in each state. Specifically, you will use <code>library(ggplot2)</code> and the function <code>geom_sf()</code> to recreate the provided image.</p>

<p>We have been asked by the state of Idaho to visualize permitted well locations with a production of more than 5000 gallons and the spatial relationship of the large wells to the locations of large dams (surface area larger than 50 acres). They have provided a a <a href="https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/shp.zip">shp file</a> for us and given us a web address for the <a href="https://data-idwr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1abb666937894ae4a87afe9655d2ff83_1">well</a>, <a href="https://data-idwr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e163d7da3b84410ab94700a92b7735ce_0">dam</a>, and <a href="https://research.idwr.idaho.gov/gis/Spatial/Hydrography/streams_lakes/c_250k/hyd250.zip">water</a> locations. They would like to have the <code>Snake River</code> and <code>Henrys Fork</code> rivers plotted.</p>
<p>Their US map is projected to show the entire US. You will need to subset the data to Idaho and then reproject the map, so Idaho is not tilted.</p>
