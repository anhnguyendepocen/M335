From this data (`nycflights13::flights`), which you can obtain in R (`install.packages("nycflights13"); library(nycflights13)`), your manager wants you to answer the following questions;

1. If I am leaving before noon, which two airlines do you recommend at each airport (JFK, LGA, EWR) that will have the lowest delay time at the 75th percentile?
2. Which origin airport is best to minimize my chances of a late arrival when I am using Delta Airlines?
3. Which destination airport is the worst (you decide on the metric for worst) airport for arrival time?

Before we can start to answer business questions we need to become familiar with our data. Often, you will want to start with the [data dictionary](https://www.bridging-the-gap.com/data-dictionary/).  However, you can also just dive into the data and gain understanding based on the variable names and types.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Beyond the variable descriptions is how the variables relate to each other. We can create tables or visualizations that summarize how different variables relate to each other. At this point we are deepeing our understanding as well as beginning our analysis.

**Remember: Your job is to become the data expert not the domain expert.** You will build domain skills but you are not going to replace domain experts. People will depend on you to have a firm understanding of what data your company has available to answer domain specific questions.

Use `nycflights13::flights` to practice your data summary and data investigation through visualization skills.

The world is a dangerous place.  During 2015 and 2016 there was a lot of discussion in the [news about police shootings](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/controversial-police-shootings/){target="blank"}.  [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/){target="blank"} reported on [gun deaths in 2016](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/){target="blank"}.  As leaders in data journalism, they have posted a clean version of this data in their GitHub repo called [full_data.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data){target="blank"} for us to use. 

While their visualizations focused on yearly averages, our client wants to create commercials that help reduce the gun deaths in the US.  They would like to target the commercials in different seasons of the year (think month variable) to audiences that could have the most impact in reducing gun deaths. Our challenge is to summarize and visualize seasonal trends accros the other variables in these data.

The [Scientific American argues](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-we-getting-taller/){target="blank"} that humans have been getting taller over the years.  As the data scientists that we are becoming, we would like to find data that validates this concept. Our challenge is to show different male heights across the centuries.  

This project is not as severe as the two quotes below, but it will give you a taste of pulling various data and file formats together into "tidy" data for visualization and analysis.

Data formats are varied and differ by domains and software.  We could spend weeks on the different formats and file types that companies and governments use to store their data.  We will practice with a few standard formats that are often used for storing data. In the future, you will most likely have to do some research to figure out other formats (but you can do it with R or Python).  We have a challenge to read in the five formats of the [DOW data](https://github.com/byuistats/data/tree/master/Dart_Expert_Dow_6month_anova){target="blank"} and checking that they are all identical using `all.equal()`. One final note, your R script should do all the work.  That is your script should download the files and/or read directly from the web location of the file.

We want to look at the returns for each six-month period of the year in which the returns were reported.  Your plot should highlight the tighter spread of the DJIA as compared to the other two selection methods (DARTS and PROS).

It is 2010, and you are working for the Idaho restaurant commission, and they need your help getting a clearer picture of how restaurant construction changed across Idaho from 2008 to 2009.  They [provided you a dataset](https://github.com/hathawayj/buildings){target="blank"} of all commercial construction in Idaho for those two years. The data has a variable `Type` with a general category called `Food_Beverage_Service` that has other buildings besides restaurants in the category.  You will need to use the restaurant names (see `restaurants` data object) and some additional key words to create the correct subgroupings. Your client expects to provide new data for 2010 and 2011 so your script needs to do the work.  Make sure you do not use Excel to manipulate anything.


1. How did full-service restaurant construction compare to quick service restaurant construction across county and years?
2. How did restaurant construction fare compare to the other commercial construction in Idaho?
3. Which county in Idaho spent the most on fast food construction each year?
4. In that county how did other commercial construction compare?

Using global regular expression print (grep) and regular expressions (regex) to find character string patterns is a valuable tool in data analysis and is available with all operating systems and many different programming languages.  It is a powerful tool once it is understood.  The recently developed `library(stringr)` package makes these tools much easier to use. The three tasks below can be completed in many different ways.

When we are visualizing data with categorical variables, we have to deal with character strings as groupings.

>>>>>>> 3555fbbcd42e43308a527a106f7c819389108e06

  

We have transaction data for a few businesses that have been in operation for three months.  Each of these companies has come to your investment company for a loan to expand their business. Your boss has asked you to go through the transactions for each business and provide daily, weekly, and monthly gross revenue summaries and comparisons.  Your boss would like a short write up with tables and visualizations that help with the decision of which company did the best over the three month period.  You will also need to provide a short paragraph with your recommendation after building your analysis. 

In our course we are only looking at understanding and visualizing recorded time series data.  If you would like to learn more about forecasting I would recommend [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://www.otexts.org/fpp2/){target="blank"} and for a quick introduction [see here](https://afit-r.github.io/ts_exploration){target="blank"}

A car wash business wants to see if the temperature hurts their bottom line.  They have point of sale data for the months of April, May, June, and July.  You will need to aggregate the data into hourly sales totals and merge the sales data together with the temperature data to provide insight into the relationship between temperature and car wash sales.

Your data science income has ballooned, and you need to find somewhere to invest $25,000 that you have saved over the last year.  You have a savvy investment friend that is kind enough to tell you ten stocks he has been watching during the last year. You will need to visualize the last five years performance to help in the in the conversation with your friend. 

Your friend is going to give you his tickers at the beginning of your half-hour meeting with him (he is a busy friend).  You will need to build an `.Rmd` file that will build a suite of visualizations rapidly for your conversation. You will need a series of stock performance graphics using `library(dygraphs)` and `library(ggplot2)`. In real life, you might use one or the other, but this task is built to help you move from `ts` and `xts` to `tidy` objects for visualization.  

Specifically, in class the Tuesday following this case study you will get 5 - 10 ticker symbols and will need to build visualizations quickly that allows you to answer questions about the stocks in a few seconds.

The stock market is overflowing with data.  There are many packages in R that allow us to get quick access to information on publicly traded companies.  Imagine that you and a friend each purchased about $1,000 of stock in three different stocks at the start of October last year, and you want to compare your performance up to this week.  Use the stock shares purchased and share prices to demonstrate how each of you fared over the period you were competing (assuming that you did not change your allocations).

Interactive visualizations can often be powerful for data investigations.  They let your team get at questions in real time.  Use the Kroger (KR) stock price to build an interactive visualization of their performance over the last five years. Take some time to build a couple of different visualizations that show Krogers performance.  See the task items below for a description.

You have been asked to support a story for the local paper (that has a web presence) that looks back on the housing collapse and the early effects of residential construction.  You have data on residential building permits from 1980 through 2010 for each county in the United States.  Your colleague that is writing the article would like a few maps and graphics that highlight the single family building permit patterns across your state as well as the patterns in the US.

Remember the big story is the collapse of new building permits at the initial stages of the [mortgage crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis){target="blank"}.  Make sure your graphics highlight the collapse in a clear and honest manner.

Up to this point, we have dealt with data that fits into the tidy format without much effort.  Spatial data has many complicating factors that have made handling spatial data in R complicated.  Big strides are being made to make spatial data tidy in R.  However; we are in the middle of the transition.

We will use `library(USAboundaries)`, `library(ggrepel)`, and `library(sf)` to make a map of the US and show the top 3 largest cities in each state. Specifically, you will use `library(ggplot2)` and the function `geom_sf()` to recreate the provided image.

We have been asked by the state of Idaho to visualize permitted well locations with a production of more than 5000 gallons and the spatial relationship of the large wells to the locations of large dams (surface area larger than 50 acres).  They have provided a a [shp file](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/shp.zip) for us and given us a web address for the [well](https://data-idwr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1abb666937894ae4a87afe9655d2ff83_1), [dam](https://data-idwr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e163d7da3b84410ab94700a92b7735ce_0), and [water](https://research.idwr.idaho.gov/gis/Spatial/Hydrography/streams_lakes/c_250k/hyd250.zip) locations. They would like to have the `Snake River` and `Henrys Fork` rivers plotted.

Their US map is projected to show the entire US.  You will need to subset the data to Idaho and then reproject the map, so Idaho is not tilted.
