### Background / Purpose

Each of you will be responsible to create a data driven question, find the data to answer this question, and build a visual analysis that answers your question with data.  A few notes on this project;

1. This project is done over a semester.  If you try to complete it during the last few weeks of the semester you will not succeed.
2. The data science majors will submit this as a part of their degree completion.  This project could be a great stepping stone for your senior project.
3. I would highly recommend that you do this project well and make it public on your Github repository to demonstrate to employers that you have data programming skills.

### Tasks

The semester project has three different tasks that need to be completed in order to fulfill the task - **question generation, data acquisition, and answer development**.

#### Question Generation & Data Acquisition


<style>
ul {

   list-style-type: none;
   list-style-position: outside;

}

</style>


* [ ] Find 4-5 examples of data-driven answers and write a one-paragraph review of each.
    * [ ] List 2-3 items that are unique/good
    * [ ] Identify 1 issue with the each example

--------

* [ ] Take notes on your reading of the specified 'R for Data Science' chapter in the README.md or in a '.R' script in the class task folder
* [ ] Develop a few novel questions that data can answer
    * [ ] Get feedback from 5-10 people on their interest in your questions and summarize this feedback
    * [ ] Find other examples of people addressing your question


#### Answer Development



* [ ] Take notes on your reading of the specified 'R for Data Science' chapter in the README.md or in a '.R' script in the class task folder
* [ ] Build an interactive document that has links to sources with a description of the quality of each
    * [ ] Find 3-5 potential data sources (that are free) and document some information about the source

--------
* [ ] Finalize first draft of your project analysis
    * [ ] Choose your flavor of `.Rmd` for your presentation
    * [ ] Build a stand-alone analysis that helps a reader answer the question at hand with that available data
* [ ] Present your visualization based analysis that addresses your question
    * [ ] Present your analysis to your roommates (or spouse) and update your presentation based on the feedback
    * [ ] Get feedback from 2-3 fellow classmates on your presentation and update it based on their feedback
    * [ ] Present your draft presentation to a data scientist to review for clarity
    * [ ] Present your work in class, at a society meeting, the research and creative works conference, or as a blog post online
