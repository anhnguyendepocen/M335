## Task 24: Coding Challenge 
### Background 
<<<<<<< HEAD

We do not have a task due outside of class for today. During class, we will do a 1-hour coding challenge to give you practice for the coding challenge on the last day of class.

This week we will learn new coding techniques and visualization principles.  However, your case study and weekly tasks will provide time to makes sure you have for the last task of the [semester project](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/project.html).
