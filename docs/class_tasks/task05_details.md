## Task 5: Making bad graphics 
### Background 

In `library(ggplot2)` there is a `diamonds` dataset that shows features of diamonds.  Your brother is about to go out and buy a diamond ring for his fiancee and needs some advice on what type of diamond to purchase. He knows that karat has a strong relationship with price.  He wants to know what other elements of the diamond he could sacrifice to maximize the karat size for a budget around $2,000. Some interesting details on diamonds can be found [here](https://www.americangemsociety.org/page/4cs){target="blank"}.
