## Task 11: Controlling categorical variables (factors) 
### Background 

When we are visualizing data with categorical variables, we have to deal with character strings as groupings. The problem with summarizing categorical data in a table or a plot is how to order the groups.  Using the concept of Factors allows us to dictate the order of these groupings for presentation. We will revisit the [stock data](https://github.com/byuistats/data/tree/master/Dart_Expert_Dow_6month_anova){target="blank"} from a previous task to create a table and a plot that has the months correctly labeled and ordered.

* [ ] Load your "tidy" data from the previous task using the stock return data
* [ ] Create a plot that shows the six-month returns by the month in which the returns are collected using the eight years of data
* [ ] Include your plots in an `.Rmd` file with short paragraph describing your plots. Make sure to display the `tidyr` code in your file
* [ ] Push your `.Rmd`, `.md`, and `.html` to your GitHub repo
