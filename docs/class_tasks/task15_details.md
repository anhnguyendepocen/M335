## Task 15:  How is the weather? 
### Background 

Use the `library(riem)` package that is described [here](https://github.com/ropensci/riem){target="blank"} and get the month of June for 2015, 2016, and 2017. You would use `riem_measures(station = "RXE", date_start = "2015-06-01", date_end = "2017-07-01")` for station `RXE`.  Once you have downloaded and formated the data, make sure to save it to your analysis folder as it will take a minute or two to download each time.   We have a few coding tasks to help us get used to using dates. Create a visualization for each question.

1. What day of the week had the highest temperature reading?
2. What day of the week had the lowest temperature at 2 pm?
