## Task 1: Understanding Graphical Perception, R, and R-Studio Setup 
### Background 
To create graphics that clearly answer questions, you must understand the basics of how the human perceptual system works. [This 40-minute talk by John Rauser](https://youtu.be/fSgEeI2Xpdc){target="blank"}, a data scientist in the technology industry, will give you an overview. You can find the code for the majority of his graphics [here](https://github.com/jrauser/writing/blob/master/how_humans_see_data/hhsd_notes.Rmd){target="blank"}.

You will also be responsible for getting R and Rstudio installed and running.
