## Task 20: Getting in SHP 
### Background 

We have been asked by the state of Idaho to visualize permitted well locations with a production of more than 5000 gallons and the spatial relationship of the large wells to the locations of large dams (surface area larger than 50 acres).  They have provided a a [shp file](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/data/shp.zip) for us and given us a web address for the [well](https://research.idwr.idaho.gov/gis/Spatial/Wells/WellConstruction/wells.zip), [dam](https://research.idwr.idaho.gov/gis/Spatial/DamSafety/dam.zip), and [water](https://research.idwr.idaho.gov/gis/Spatial/Hydrography/streams_lakes/c_250k/hyd250.zip) locations. They would like to have the `Snake River` and `Henrys Fork` rivers plotted.

Their US map is projected to show the entire US.  You will need to subset the data to Idaho and then reproject the map, so Idaho is not tilted.
